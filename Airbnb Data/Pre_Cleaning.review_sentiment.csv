"37380","6990881","9/2/13","7761354","Martyn","Arriving from Kuala Lumpur to hear that our family had broken down on the way to meet us, we arrived a little jaded.  Ann could not have been more welcoming and helpful.  The rooms were extremely spacious and comfortable, there was everything you could need and Ann even offered to take us to find somewhere to eat.  
<br/>Next morning she rang round for us to find a hire car and even took us back to the airport to collect it.  What a welcome to Australia.  We would certainly stay there again and hope to need less help another time!  It is only a 10-15 minutes from the airport in a very pleasant suburb,
<br/>We really recommend this to anyone looking for a near-airport base.","3"

"37380","92105405","8/7/16","45626307","Sanjukta","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Ann's place - she and her husband Barry were very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were well appointed with quality linen and toiletries and furniture.<br/>Breakfast provisions were very generous and of high quality - fruits, bread, milk, tea-coffee, cereals etc where plentiful and also replenished which added bonus value. <br/>The only drawback was that the place is not really a separate apartment but the bottom floor of a 2 storey house. There was no door which we could shut to close off our area so the lack of privacy was an issue. <br/>The other issue was that the kitchen was not well equipped for cooking full meals and especially for families with small kids since there was no plastic cups, plates etc. However, Ann provided us with everything that we needed as soon as we asked - extra crockery and pots and pans.<br/>I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a home-away from home experience in Brisbane's northern suburbs ","3"

The apartment is a short cab ride from the airport and we found it to be clean and spacious with fresh bed linen and towels. Our son enjoyed a few dips in the pool. A great selection of healthy breakfast food was provided. Ann was friendly and welcoming on our arrival and departure but otherwise left us to ourselves. I would recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a convenient base to the airport. Thanks Ann.","3"

The house is very conveniently located 10 mins from the airport and 20 mins from the CBD. Ann is an outstanding host who went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The breakfast items, bread, fruit and milk were thoughtful touches and very much appreciated by us. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at Ann's place when I next visit Brisbane.","4"

Even though the apartment sits below the main house any upstairs noise was infrequent, muffled and dull. We had a 3 night stay, out during the day, back at night and slept very well.<br/>We saw Ann on check in & out but not in between.

Didn't need my car at all, as you can walk or take the ferry to all main Brisbane attractions. Parking was really easy, right in front of the house, the street is quiet so doesn't seem to ever run out of parking spots, it also feels really safe to walk at night. The place is small and so is the bed, but is lovely, clean and offers everything you would need for a short stay. Would love to be back and totally recommend it.

She prepared the place nicely incl some breakfast supplies to get us started. She always responded quickly to my messages and was ok for our friends to leave some supplies. <br/>The place is perfect for families of four plus baby, it's spotless clean, there is enough space, laundry facilities and a pool. There is a bus stop next to the house getting you conveniently to the next suburb or into the city. However, it can be quite noisy due to a larger road close by, better use the aircon instead of an open window.","4"
